    <p>The driver lineup was also very special. They had mario Andretti that had already made a name for himself in indycar before driving for Lotus in F1. </p>
    <p>The second driver was Ronnie Petersson. He was already a multiple race winner before the 1978 season and probably ended his carrer as one of the best to never win the world championship</p>

    <p>At the start of the Italian grand prix in 1978 Ronnie lined up 5th for the start. The cars in the back of the grid didn't fully stop before the race started. Because of this there was too many cars at one place and unfortunately Ronnie got hit. The day after the accident he died in the hospital only 34 years old</p>
