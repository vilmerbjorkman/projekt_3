    <h1>Ferrari f2004</h1>    
    <h2>A real Italian beast</h2>
    <img src="03-2004-ferrari-F2004.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Ferrari had won the last 4 drivers championships and last 5 constructiors. Altho they had dominated most of the seasons 2003 was not the case. Shumacher won the campionship with only one single point over Kimi RÃ¤ikonnen. Ferrari had to step up their game for 2004 to win again and they really did. The car had a different philosopy then most of the other teams, they made a car that was fast over a few laps but then dropped of and had to go in and pit. The F2004 was so fast it had lap records at most cicuits untill the last three years when Mercedes could finally take them.</p>
    <h2>The drivers</h2>

    <p>For the 2004 season Ferrari had the same lineup as they have had since 2000. It was Michael Shumacher which is one of the best Formula 1 drivers ever in the prime of his carrer. Alongside him was Rubens Barrichello who had the roe as a second driver in the team. He is known to be one of the greatest ever to not win the title altho he never really got the chance. The plan was allways to let Schumacher win and not really give Barrichellothe chance he deserved.</p>
    <h2>The beautiful sound</h2>

    <p>I couldn't write about the f2004 without letting you have a chance to listen to it. The naturally aspirated v10 makes such a beautiful and deep sound and it is probably the best sounding Formula 1 car ever made.</p>
