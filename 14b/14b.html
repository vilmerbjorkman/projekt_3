    <p>Williams had since 1986 developed a active suspention system and in the FW14b they perfected the system. The designer behind the genius systemis called Patty Lowe, In the podcast behind the grid he said the system gained about one second per lap. The video above is from th FW15 that had perfected the features even more but the competitors had caught up a bit by then and it was not as dominant as it predecesor </p>
    <h2>Traction control</h2>

    <p>It was not only the active suspention that was a real gamechanger. According to Patty Lowe the traction control was even better than the active suspention. What it did was for example to turn of some cylinders at the exit of a corner to give the car the maximum amount of grip available. When they first tried the system out they wrote a code in only a few hours that Alain Prost then could try out. When he came in he said the system was bad and held him back, but when he looked at the timing charts he changed his opinion. His time was the fastest of the day altho he didn't feel comfortable in the car.</p>
    <h2>The drivers</h2>

    <p>The drivers was two of the best of one of the most stacked grids ever. It was the previously mention Alain Prost and the british icon Nigel Mansell. Nigell Mansell had been really close to winning the title many times before but he never seemed to finish it. For example in 1986 with Williams he lost title in the last race when his tire blew up.</p>
