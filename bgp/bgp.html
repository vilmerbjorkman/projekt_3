    <h1>Brawn BGP001</h1>
    <h2>The greatest success story in Formula 1 history</h2>
    <p>The story about the Brawn gp Formula 1 team is a really special story. During the financial crisis in 2008 Honda decided to withdraw from Formula 1 because of financial problems. Because of the financial crisis they had a hart time selling it. With two weeks left until the season began one of the leaders during the Ferrari dominance bought the team for only one pound. He also got the millions it would take for Honda to withdraw from the project.</p>
    <p>what Ross Brawn didn't know when he bought the team was that Honda had made a fantastic car for the new regulations in 2009. He got offers for both Ferrari and Mercedes engines but chose Mercedes because they were most similar to the Honda one the car was made for. This led to a fantastic package and at the first round of the season they got a 1-2 finish. Altho they didn't have cash to develop the car at all during the season the lead they got was enough to claim both the drivers and constructors championship. </p>
