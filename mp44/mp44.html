    <p>For the 1988 season Mclaren had finally made a deal with Honda for their engines. Although it was the last season when formula 1 cars was alowed to have turbo engines mclaren switched to Honda and the effects were imediate. Some of the other cars had already made the switch to naturally aspirated engines and this led to a big gain for Mclaren. It was the start of a relationship with Honda that led to four consecutive drivers and constructors chamionships.</p>
    <h2>The drivers</h2>
    <img src="senna-prost.jpg" alt="">
    <p>It was not only a beautiful and fantastic car, the driver lineup was probably one of the best in history. Ayrton Senna was hungry for his first world title after driving a few seasons for Lotus and stacking upp his victories. Prost had already won the titles in Both 85 and 86 and was one of the best drivers in the best driver genration ever.</p>
    <h2>What happened during the season?</h2>
    <p>It ended up being one of the biggest driver rivalries ever and Ayrton Senna came up on top in the mp4/4. But in 1989 Alain Prost came back stronger and won the title after a controversial crash into the side of Senna at suzuka. Alain Prost said he couldn't work with Senna after 1989 and joined Ferrari for 1990. The rivalry continued until Alain Prost retired after winning his last title in 1993</p>
