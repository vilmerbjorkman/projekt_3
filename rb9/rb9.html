    <h1>Red Bull RB9</h1>
    <img src="Renault_Red_Bull_RB9_-_Sebastian_Vettel_(8492547477).jpg" alt="">
    <h2>The Red Bull winning machine</h2>
    <p>Yes it is the energy drink company and yes they are extremely succesful in Formula 1. They had already won the 2010, 2011 and 2012 constructors and drivers championship but 2013 was on a different level. Sebastian Vettel won all of the 9 last races of the season, a record that will be really hard to break. The era of Red Bull domination was a really frustrating one for the fans because the races they won was so dominant. </p>
    <h2>The engineering genius Adrian Newey</h2>
    <img src="adrian.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Red Bull had a winning team for the season and one of the best and most succesful car designers in Formula 1 history, Adrian newey. This is not the only winning machine he has designed, he has won a total of 11 formula 1 world titles. It seems like the team he's in is the one that is dominating.</p>
    <h2>The drivers</h2>
    <img src="drivers.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The driver lineup was the same from 2010 when they started winning all the way untill 2013. It was the young 3 time world champion Sebastian vettel and the experienced Australian driver Mark Webber. They didn't have the best relationship which led to some nasty collitions. Sebastian won his 4th consecutive title this season and it was probably his last alhto he was only 26 years old.</p>
