    <h1>Brawn BGP01</h1>

    <h2>The greatest success story in Formula 1 history</h2>
    <p>The story about the Brawn gp Formula 1 team is a really special story. During the financial crisis in 2008 Honda decided to withdraw from Formula 1 because of financial problems. Because of the financial crisis they had a hart time selling it. With two weeks left until the season began one of the leaders during the Ferrari dominance bought the team for only one pound. He also got the millions it would take for Honda to withdraw from the project.</p>
    <p>what Ross Brawn didn't know when he bought the team was that Honda had made a fantastic car for the new regulations in 2009. He got offers for both Ferrari and Mercedes engines but chose Mercedes because they were most similar to the Honda one the car was made for. This led to a fantastic package and at the first round of the season they got a 1-2 finish. Altho they didn't have cash to develop the car at all during the season the lead they got was enough to claim both the drivers and constructors championship. </p>
    <h2>The drivers</h2>

    <p>The lineup for Brwn Gp was the same as Honda had the year before. Both had some experience from before and Barrichello had even been in a title winning car five times before. Jenson Button had one race win under his belt and was the driver that came out on top.  </p>
    <h2>The double diffuser</h2>

    <p>One of the reasons Brawn GP could win the title in the first year was beacause the loophole they found in the regulations. It helped them produce more downforce and win the races at the start of the season. If you want to know more about how it works you can check the video above.</p>
